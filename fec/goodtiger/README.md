🐯 Tigrinho do Bem

Tigrinho do Bem is an educational and humorous web project created for the FEC (Feira Cultural da Uniara) with the goal of raising awareness about how casino and betting games really work.

The game uses memes and funny images instead of real cards or money, simulating slot-machine mechanics to teach players an important lesson:

🎯 In gambling, the chances of losing are much higher than the chances of winning.
